## ARC rationale

On the 10th of January 2021, with the results of AIP-7, the Aave governance updated the Safety module emission program distributing 550 AAVE/day to AAVE stakers.

On the 9th of February 2021, with the results of AIP-9, the Aave governance introduced BPT staking for ETH/AAVE LPs on the Balancer protocol with a 550 AAVE/day distribution to BPT stakers.

As we're reaching the soft deadline for the second quarter of the emission program, this AIP intent to gather community support for continuation of the emission program.

# ARC content in short

* Keep Slashing for the Safety Module with a maximum slashing threshold at 30% of Staked Amount
* Keep the Safety Incentives for AAVE staking to 550 AAVE per day and the Safety Incentives for BPT staking at 550 AAVE per day. The new total staking reward remains at 1100 AAVE per day.
